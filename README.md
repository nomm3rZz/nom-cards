This resource, developed by nomm3rZz, introduces a Card Design System for frameworks like QBCore and QBXCore, allowing players to type in set commands to display customizable card designs directly in their view. Initially designed for PD Miranda Rights for new trainees, the system is fully customizable for any job and any card design.
